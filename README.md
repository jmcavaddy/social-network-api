# Social Network API

## Description
I built a social media API to layout some boilerplate back end code for a social media application. This API could help someone who is interested more in the front-end necessary for a successful social media application. I learned about how to create RESTful APIs using MongoDB.

## Installation
To run the social media API, clone the repo from my GitHub, type `npm i` into your CLI to install necessary dependencies, and then type `npm start` to launch the server. Once the server is live, you can test the endpoints using a REST client like Insomnia. For a demo, checkout [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/KYENQ4Vztrs).

## Usage
This software should be used as a framework for a social media application.
